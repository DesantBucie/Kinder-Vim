## ~~CHECK~~ VIM9 BRANCH ~~THIS~~ WILL PROBABLY BE NOT DEVELOPED ANY MORE

## Before we start

See mistake or sh$tty code? Tell me. Just tell me and i'll fix it.

This is built for touchbar mac, but works fine on normal pc, just make your own bindings.

## What's the point

I want it to be *easy* and *useful*.

It integrates minifying and unminifying code from Vim, you just need to call one function,
and it detects automaticaly if code is going to be minified or unminified.

You can also open pdf from Vim, or any other file with just one press on touchbar.

## Advices

Do not use esc, especially on touchbar macbooks 2016-20**, map esc to caps lock.

System preferences => keyboard => modifier keys (bottom right)
